## Introduction

CodeSandbox offers a fully collaborative cloud development environment for teams to code, share and collaborate across multiple devices. The core vision of CodeSandbox is to empower users to start coding instantly with minimal prior knowledge, while also providing a platform to easily discover examples.

In addition to its collaborative functions, CodeSandbox makes the development process easier by offering an extensive library of pre-configured templates, libraries and frameworks. This allows users to start coding without spending much time setting up environments.

CodeSandbox runs your project and turns it into a link you can share with anyone. By following the link everyone can see your running code, and with “fork” they can get a copy within 2 seconds so they can easily contribute back.                                                                                                                                    |
| GitHub App                                                          | The integration between CodeSandbox and Github allows you to instantly run every pull request and include all the review tooling you need to accelerate the review process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Context-Aware AI assistant: Boxy (Available to all Pro subscribers) | CodeSandbox has created an AI coding companion called Boxy to make development more accessible and to increase your state of flow. Boxy can assist you directly through the app preview and provide you with explanations and insights, as well as generate new code for your project that is tailored to your specific context within CodeSandbox.                                                                                                                                    |

Dev Containers allows you to customize your own container using Dockerfile, or you can use existing container images to set up your development environment. With Dev Containers you can enhance your environment by adding features on top of the container, and you can also use Docker Compose or a Dockerfile to run additional services.                                  |
| Powerful DevTools                                                   | CodeSandbox allows you to add as many DevTools as you want, and with DevTools you can create shortcuts to run any command. DevTools are useful for debugging, testing, and developing, and you can share their content as they are collaborative by default. <br/> <br/> Available DevTools: <br/> - Preview <br/> - Task <br/> - Terminal <br/> - VM resource usage <br/> - Debug (Chrome DevTools)                                                                                   |

| VS Code Extension                                                   | VS Code extensions is beneficial for collaboration, and it allows all your team members to follow your steps on VS Code without leaving the Web Editor. You can choose if you want to use the CodeSandbox editor for VS Code, or you can do all your work in VS Code without accessing CodeSandbox on the web. The CodeSandbox GitHub App will let you review PRs directly from VS Code while connected to CodeSandbox, where every PR will have a link to open the branch in VS Code. |
| Online Code Editor                                                  | CodeSandbox has a web editor with a variety of templates, frameworks and playgrounds that allows you to code anything right from your browser, from prototypes to full-scale projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Market Comparison

In the competitive landscape of online integrated development environments (IDEs), CodeSandbox stands out as a specialized platform for web development. Its primary competitors include Replit, StackBlitz, CodePen, and Glitch.

CodeSandbox distinguishes itself by focusing specifically on web development, offering pre-configured environments for various frameworks and libraries commonly used in front-end and back-end development. This specialization makes it an attractive choice for developers looking for a comprehensive solution tailored to their needs.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**

One of CodeSandbox's key strengths lies in its comprehensive feature set. It provides support for multiple files, dependencies management, live previews, built-in terminals, and collaboration tools, all within a simple and intuitive interface. It seamlessly integrates with version control systems like Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, allowing developers to import existing projects or save work directly to repositories.

Despite its strengths, CodeSandbox may have a learning curve for new users with less development knowledge, mainly those unfamiliar with its feature set. The platform's performance may be impacted by the complexity of projects, particularly those with numerous dependencies.

### CodeSandbox vs Replit

CodeSandbox and Replit are both online platforms designed to help developers write, share, and collaborate on web development projects. While they share similarities, there are some key differences between them:
